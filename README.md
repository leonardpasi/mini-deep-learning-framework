# mini_deep_learning_framework

## Overview
This repo contains an implementation of a mini deep learning framework. The framework, built using only PyTorch's tensor operations and the standard math library, offers user-friendly tools for constructing multi-layer perceptrons with various activation functions. It also supports training with a range of optimizers (SGD, RMSprop, Adam) and loss functions.

This work was completed in **2021** as part of the graded project for the EPFL Deep Learning course, taught by Prof. François Fleuret. As the requirements were vastly exceeded, the final grade was **6/6**.

## Repository structure

- **`documents/`**: Contains the guideline for the project (see *Project 2 – Mini deep-learning framework*, which is the one I personally focused on), and our final report.
- **`src/`**: Contains the main source code of the project.
  - `Model_NN.py` and `Activation_Functions.py` contain all the building blocks of the framework
  - All other modules contains code to test the framework and compare it to PyTorch, according to the guidelines
